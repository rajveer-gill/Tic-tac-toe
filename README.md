# Tic-tac-toe

## Description
The project I built is a computer version of the popular game known as Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is a two player game as the players take turns marking the board until the board is filled out or if one of the players get 3 symbols in a row. "X" is for player 1 and "O" is for player 2. I built this project in order to build on my C++ skills and do more work with multi-dimensional arrays.

## Features
The project specializes in working with 2D arrays. It is able to pass arrays through functions, analyze the arrays, and make any changes if necessary. It takes in user input and reflects those choices upon a 3 by 3 game board. Play continues until the board is filled out or the game detects a symbol aligned in a 3 in a row pattern.

## How to Use
In order to use the code for this project, download the zip file and open it. From there, upload the project and its contents to your local compiler. You can find a large variety of C compilers online to use.

## Technologies
The system used to create this app was a MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has an 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 16 GB of memory.

## Collaborators
I was able to accomplish this with the assistance of Pearson's Starting out with C++ sixth edition textbook.
